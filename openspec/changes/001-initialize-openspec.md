# Change Proposal: Initialize OpenSpec Framework

**ID**: 001
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Author**: AI Assistant
**Status**: Completed
**Type**: Infrastructure

## Summary
Initialize OpenSpec specification-driven development framework for the Everyday Christian landing page project to enable better planning, documentation, and change management.

## Motivation
- Need structured approach to managing future changes
- Desire to document architectural decisions
- Preparing for Phase 2 blog implementation
- Enable AI assistants to understand project context better

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure
```
openspec/
├── AGENTS.md                           # AI assistant instructions
├── changes/                            # Change proposals
│   └── 001-initialize-openspec.md     # This file
└── specs/                              # Technical specifications
    ├── design-system.md               # Design system documentation
    └── phase2-blog-architecture.md    # Phase 2 blog spec
```

### Files Created

#### `openspec/AGENTS.md`
- Project overview and technology stack
- Exact Flutter design system values
- Development guidelines
- File organization
- Code style standards
- Animation patterns
- Git workflow
- Phase 2 blog architecture overview
- Key constraints and best practices
- Current project state

#### `openspec/specs/design-system.md`
- Complete color palette with Flutter equivalents
- Glassmorphism specifications
- Typography system
- Cosmic aurora background implementation
- Border radius values
- Shadow definitions
- Blur values
- Button styles
- Animation keyframes
- Cross-platform consistency matrix

#### `openspec/specs/phase2-blog-architecture.md`
- Complete technology stack
- Database schema (blog_posts, blog_comments, blog_reactions)
- Storage bucket configuration
- Row Level Security policies
- API endpoints documentation
- Admin dashboard features
- Public blog features
- Content type interfaces
- Implementation phases (2a, 2b, 2c)
- SEO considerations
- Migration plan from static posts
- Future enhancements roadmap

## Impact

### Affected Components
- None (infrastructure only)

### Benefits
1. **Better Planning**: All changes can be proposed and documented before implementation
2. **AI Context**: AI assistants can read AGENTS.md to understand project fully
3. **Knowledge Base**: Technical decisions are documented in specs/
4. **Change Tracking**: Historical record of why changes were made
5. **Onboarding**: New developers can read specs to understand architecture

### Risks
- None (additive only)

## Implementation Details

### Manual Setup (No CLI)
Since @openspec/cli is not available in npm registry, created directory structure manually:
```bash
mkdir -p openspec/changes openspec/specs
```

Created all documentation files following the OpenSpec specification format.

## Testing
- Verified directory structure created correctly
- Confirmed all markdown files are valid and readable
- Validated that AGENTS.md contains accurate project context

## Rollback Plan
Not applicable - documentation only, no code changes.

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Create directory structure
2. ✅ Write AGENTS.md
3. ✅ Document design system
4. ✅ Document Phase 2 blog architecture
5. ⏳ Begin Phase 2a implementation
6. ⏳ Set up Supabase project
7. ⏳ Create database schema
